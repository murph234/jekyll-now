title: A New Blog
---
Well, been a while since my last post.  This one will be a bit meta, as I've moved the 
blog off Blogger to a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based site hosted on 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  I wanted to move to a 
hosting provider that let me do what I felt like layout-wise, not constrained by a CMS
or limited templates.  Using GitHub led me to look at Jekyll. I've wanted to try a static
website generator for a while, as I've got another site that could make use of one. So a
good educational exercise.

For now I've forked a package called [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
to get things going.  I'll play around with the layout for a while, figuring out what I
want but this will do for a start.
