I'm sitting here watching Yuri Milner's [Starshot](http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3) announcement, and it's pretty exciting.  Not necessarily new ideas (think von Neumann probes) but inspiring to see some level of commitment to the idea.  And I like that Avi Loeb brought up the idea of using them "locally" as well.  Think of being able to quickly scramble a small, cheap, fast probe to a point in the solar system when we see something interesting about to happen, and not needing years of travel and development time.  I'm pragmatic about this possibilities of this project, but it's an exciting time!
